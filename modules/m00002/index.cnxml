<title>Computer programs</title>
<para id="para-00002">A <term id="term-00001">computer</term> is an electronic device that stores and processes information. Examples of computers include smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and servers. Technically speaking, a <term id="term-00002">program</term> is a sequence of instructions that a computer can run. Programs help people accomplish everyday tasks, create new technology, and have fun.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The goal of this book is to teach introductory programming and problem solving. Writing programs is a creative activity, inherently useful, and rewarding!
No prior background in mathematics or computer science is necessary to read this book. Many different types of programs exist, as shown in the illustration below.
This book will focus on general purpose programs that typically run "behind the scenes."</para>
